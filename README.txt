INTRODUCTION
------------

The RiotJS module loads the riot.min.js file so that developers can depend on it when building Riot.js (see http://riotjs.com/) components.

After installing (see INSTALLATION below),

 * create a library that has a dependency on riotjs/riotjs. See https://drupal.org/node/2274843#library for further information.
 * Then create your Riot components and add their pre-compiled tags (see http://riotjs.com/guide/compiler/#pre-compilation) to your library.


INSTALLATION
------------

 * Download the minified Riot.js file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riot/riot/master/riot.min.js and make sure it's accessible from /libraries/riotjs/riot.min.js.
 * Install the module as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See: https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8 for further information.
